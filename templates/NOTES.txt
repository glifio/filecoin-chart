1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
{{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
  http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}
IPFS, StateDiff, Powergate and Lotus node will be available by /ipfs, /StateDiff /powergate, and /lotus paths accordingly if enabled.
{{- end }}
If you use api-service schema, then IPFS, StateDiff, Powergate will be available by /service/ipfs,StateDiff,powergate paths accordingly if enabled.
Lotus apiDNS service has link: {{- if .Values.Lotus.enabled }} {{ .Release.Name }}-lotus-service {{- end }}.
Use this variable during deployment service in "apiDNS" ( --set .Values.apiDNS={{ .Release.Name }}-lotus-service or in file service.yaml )
